# Build once deploy everywhere

The Paloma protocol is designed to work across any target chain. Any application that wants to make use of Palomas cross-chain messaging and scheduling capabilities can build on top of the protocol. Since the protocol is fully permissionless anyone can deploy applications on the Paloma blockchain or any target chain. 

There are currently two applications powered by the Paloma team that are available to use for any developer. 
- Compass EVM smart contract
- On chain price oracle with price data from Pyth
